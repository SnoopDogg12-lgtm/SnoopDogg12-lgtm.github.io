    <hr>
    <p class="about-ps">Hi, my name is Stivan and I'm an undergraduate computer science student and 
        an aspiring software developer. I got into computers and programming when I was 16 and ever
        since I have been pursuing my dream of becoming a developer. 
    </p>
    <p class="about-ps">
        I have completed a Level 3 BTEC Computing course, which taught me a lot about project managament
        and programming. Thanks to these two subjects, I realised how fascinating it is to work on
        projects for clients and ever since I have been very interested in doing exactly that.
    </p>
    <p class="about-ps">
        During my second year of college I also worked in "Spacebar" which is essentially a company that
        makes websites for local businesses. This is where I learnt a lot about working with clients and
        turning their requirments into real products.

    <p id="projects-ps">
        Here are some of the projects that taught me a lot about programming and the ones
        that I am most proud of.

        <div class="dd">
            <h1>Dungeons and Dragons Character creator</h1>
            <p>Language: C#</p>
            <p>A college project.</p>
            <p>The aim was to make a medium sized software with C# UI Library and learn how 
                to handle data in general.
                In this case C# Forms.
                The software itself is a character builder which provides a lot of functionality.

            <h1>Plants vs Zombie Fan made version</h1>
            <p>Language: Python</p>
            <p>Side project</p>
            <p>A game that I always loved and decided to kind of remake and add
                features that were never implemented to it. Really special project as it
                was the first game I ever created.

            <h1>Full-stack quiz website</h1>
            <p>Language: Javascript</p>
            <p>Side Project</p>
            <p>The first serious and actually completed Full-stack project I ever worked on.
                It uses technologies such as React, MongoDb and Express.js.
